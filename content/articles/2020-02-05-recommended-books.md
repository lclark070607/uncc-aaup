There Is No Excuse for How Universities Treat Adjuncts:
Students are paying higher tuition than ever. Why can’t more of that revenue go to the people teaching them?

Caroline Fredrickson
September 2015
The Atlantic

“Nowhere has the up-classing of contingency work gone farther, ironically, than in one of the most educated and (back in the day) secure sectors of the workforce: college teachers. In 1969, almost 80 percent of college faculty members were tenure or tenure track. Today, the numbers have essentially flipped, with two-thirds of faculty now non-tenure and half of those working only part-time, often with several different teaching jobs….

In his book The Fissured Workplace, David Weil of the Boston University School of Management (and currently the administrator of the U.S. Wage and Hour Division in the U.S. Department of Labor) writes that the growth of contingent employment is being driven mostly by firms focusing on their core businesses and outsourcing the rest of the work to contractors. But teaching students is—or at least is supposed to be—the core mission of higher education. That colleges and universities have turned more and more of their frontline employees into part-time contractors suggests how far they have drifted from what they say they are all about (teaching students) to what they are increasingly all about (conducting research, running sports franchises, or, among for-profits, delivering shareholder value).”

The Death of an Adjunct
Thea Hunter was a promising, brilliant scholar. And then she got trapped in academia’s permanent underclass.

Adam Harris
April 2019
The Atlantic

“To be a perennial adjunct professor is to hear the constant tone of higher education’s death knell. The story is well known—the long hours, the heavy workload, the insufficient pay—as academia relies on adjunct professors, non-tenured faculty members, who are often paid pennies on the dollar to do the same work required of their tenured colleagues.

The position is often inaccurately described as akin to a form of slavery. Thea, a scholar of rights, slavery, and freedom, would have been the first to say that is not the case. It is more like the lowest rung in a caste system, the one that underrepresented minorities tend to call home….
 
Just as the doors of academe have been opened more widely than heretofore to marginalized groups, the opportunity structure for academic careers has been turned on its head,” a 2016 report on faculty diversity from the TIAA Institute, a nonprofit research center focused in part on higher education, reads. From 1993 to 2013, the percentage of underrepresented minorities in non-tenure-track part-time faculty positions in higher education grew by 230 percent. By contrast, the percentage of underrepresented minorities in full-time tenure-track positions grew by just 30 percent.
 
Nearly 80 percent of faculty members were tenured or tenure-track in 1969. Now roughly three-quarters of faculty are nontenured.”

Bureaucrats And Buildings: The Case For Why College Is So Expensive

Caroline Simon
September 2017
Forbes

“Today’s skyrocketing college costs – between $80,000 and $180,000 for a public or private four-year degree, respectively – and the mounting $1.3 trillion student debt crisis have brought universities’ spending under increasing scrutiny.…

Over the last decades, the higher education world has witnessed a sharp upswing in administrative spending.

More administrators, fewer answers
During the 1980-1981 school year, public and private institutions spent $20.7 billion in total on instruction, and $13 billion on academic support, student services and institutional support combined, according to data from the National Center for Educational Statistics. By the 2014-2015 school year, total instructional costs had climbed to $148 billion, while the same grouping of administrative expenses had risen to $122.3 billion.
 
Put another way, administrative spending comprised just 26% of total educational spending by American colleges in 1980-1981, while instructional spending comprised 41%. Three decades later, the two categories were almost even.”

What Lorgia García Peña’s Tenure Denial Means for Other Latina Scholars
Her rejection continues a long tradition in academia of ignoring the brilliance of Afro Latinx scholars and educators

Aurora Santiago Ortiz
December 2019
Zora / Medium

“Dr. García Peña’s teaching is highly regarded; her book, The Borders of Dominicanidad: Race, Nations, and Archives of Contradictions (Duke University Press, 2016) won the 2017 National Women’s Studies Association’s Gloria E. Anzaldúa Book Prize, and she is the recipient of grants and fellowships from a number of prestigious foundations, such as the Ford Foundation.

Yet for many of us Latinx, Black, and other scholars of color, the news, although outrageous, was unsurprising. Black, Brown, Indigenous, and other faculty of color are underrepresented in academia. Black women represent 4% of assistant (untenured) professors, Latina professors 3%, and American Indian/Alaska Natives less than 1%.
 
We know of multiple cases of tenure denial to nonwhite scholars. There is also the case of Amiee Bahng, who was denied tenure at Dartmouth College in 2016, and Albert Laguna who was denied tenure at Yale in 2019. There are many more cases of Black, Latinx, and other POC faculty that never make it into the public eye. Moreover, there is no database that tracks this information; the reasons for the denial are not transparent and, in the case of Harvard, there is no uniform process to evaluate professors for tenure and promotion.

Higher Education’s Reckoning with Slavery
Two decades of activism and scholarship have led to critical self-examination.
 
Leslie M. Harris
January 2020
ACADEME (AAUP journal)

“The examination of the history of higher education’s support of slavery and accompanying racist ideologies has developed into a flourishing field of academic research and inquiry. Whether the recovery of this history will be an effective tool for institutional change remains to be seen.
 
At the outset of this movement, most institutions feared the impact of such projects on their reputations and particularly on alumni donations. Would recovering these institutional histories discourage donors, or make colleges and universities targets for right-wing or left-wing provocateurs? But in most cases, such fears have been overcome by rigorous research and a refusal to pander to politics from any part of the ideological spectrum. Indeed, this new field of inquiry has also engaged students, particularly undergraduates, in historical research that has real-world applicability.”

Black Study, Black Struggle

Robin D.G. Kelley
March 2016
Boston Review

“Likewise the demands from protesters at UNC, Chapel Hill are a model for radical global politics. They include ending ties to prisons and sweated labor; retraining and disarming campus police; offering free childcare for students, staff, and faculty; and paying a minimum wage of $25 per hour for workers, with the addendum “that all administrators be compensated at the same rate as workers.” Many will say these are not winnable demands, but winning is not always the point. Unveiling the university’s exploitative practices and its deeply embedded structures of racism, sexism, and class inequality can be profound acts of demystification on their own….

Fugitive Study
Black studies was conceived not just outside the university but in opposition to a Eurocentric university culture with ties to corporate and military power. Having emerged from mass revolt, insurgent black studies scholars developed institutional models based in, but largely independent of, the academy. In later decades, these institutions were—with varying degrees of eagerness—incorporated into the university proper in response to pressure to embrace multiculturalism.”

Campus cops are shadowy, militarized and more powerful than ever

Christopher Moraff 
July 2015
Washington Post

“The Department of Justice reports that in 2012, 75 percent of public and private four-year colleges employed armed police and guards, up from 68 percent in 2005. Over the same period, the percentage of campuses with armed private security guards grew from 2 percent to 11 percent, according to the Center for Investigative Reporting.

And just like their colleagues in municipal law enforcement, campus police departments have been supplementing their arsenals with hardware designed for war. According to the New York Times, as of last year more than 100 colleges had acquired surplus military equipment including assault rifles, armored vehicles and at least one grenade launcher through the Department of Defense’s 1033 program.
Some campus PDs even have their own SWAT team, including the University of Delaware, Radford University in Virginia, the University of Georgia and the University of North Carolina-Charlotte.”

“Silent Sam” at UNC: A Pretext for Mobile Police Forces, Crowd Control, and Intelligence Gathering?

Michael Behrent, statewide AAUP president
December 2018
Academe Blog

“Thus while the “Silent Sam” decision seemed, at first glance, to be a fairly craven response to pressure from the Republican-dominated Board of Governors, it is apparent, upon closer examination, that it is far more insidious: it uses the protest movement that the statue generated (and which was supported by many  faculty) as a pretext to militarize university campuses. The creation of a special police force across the UNC system, intended to be used primarily to respond to protestors, has very troubling implications for protecting First Amendment rights on campuses. The notion that politically active students—and presumably faculty—would be thought of as requiring “crowd control” and necessitating “intelligence gathering” hardly seems compatible with any traditional idea of the university. And it is mind-boggling that a report by a university governing board would characterize the decisions of local judges protecting citizens’ rights as a “security risk.”
